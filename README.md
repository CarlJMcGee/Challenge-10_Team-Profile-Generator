## Description

This tool makes managing your team easier than ever! Just follow the on screen prompts and in no time you'll have an index.html file ready for deployment.

You will be asked to enter a "manager" first, then you have the option to enter either an "engineer" or an "intern". Once you've entered their respective name, employee ID, email, and either a Github username for engineers, or a school name for interns, you'll have the option to enter another engineer/intern or your can finalize your team! After that, the tool will generate an html file in the "dist" folder.

Check out the demo index.html inside the "demo" folder or check out this [video demonstration](https://youtu.be/ICqwqgqBoq8).
